porting from https://github.com/tonyx/orderssystem
- sql is the same: you may take the .sql script from plain that version of orderssystem
- some bugs has been fixed
- localization can't work using xml based properties (becasue of problem of donet core with Fsharp.configuration). As workaround for now I have plain .fs source files for strings

info: a newer version of ordersystem .net/mono version was on my old dead laptop, so now, untill I get it from backup/time machine, I'll rewrite such features in this .net core version. I can't work easily on the .net/mono version from a cheap laptop someone lent me, so at the moment this is the official maintained version.
